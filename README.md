# Resume Builder


**Hi, this is Satya Sai Yerra. Due to the size of my project (30MB), 
I am unable to upload it to GitHub in its entirety. Instead, 
I have divided the project into multiple zip files, which need to be manually extracted and combined.**

# * 1. Download All Zip Files*: 
         Ensure you have downloaded all the zip files associated with this project.
#    2. *Extract Files*:
       - Extract each zip file.
       - Combine the contents of all extracted zip files into a single directory. 
         Make sure that file paths and directory structures remain intact to avoid overwriting or misplacing any files.
#  - 3. *Execute the Project*:
     - Navigate to the root directory of the combined project files.
     - Follow the specific execution or build instructions provided below.
